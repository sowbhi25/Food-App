The lentils are soaked, ground into a coarse batter, and mixed with spices such as cumin, fennel seeds, green chilies, curry leaves, and onions. This mixture is shaped into small patties and deep-fried until crispy and golden brown. Parupu Vadai is typically enjoyed with coconut chutney or sambar and is a staple during festivals, special occasions, or as an accompaniment to evening tea. Its crunchy texture and flavorful spices make it a favorite among street food lovers in India.')"/>

The marinade can vary widely, from simple blends of olive oil, garlic, and lemon to more complex mixes featuring yogurt, spices like cumin, paprika, and turmeric, or even Asian-inspired sauces with soy, ginger, and sesame. The grilling process imparts a smoky flavor while keeping the chicken tender and juicy. Chicken skewers are a versatile dish, often served at barbecues, picnics, or gatherings, and can be paired with a variety of sides such as salads, flatbreads, or dipping sauces like tzatziki or hummus.')"/>

The batter is poured into the molds and cooked until the paniyarams become golden and crispy on the outside, while soft and fluffy inside. Paniyaram can be made in both savory and sweet varieties. Savory paniyarams are often seasoned with mustard seeds, curry leaves, onions, and chilies, while the sweet version is made with jaggery or coconut.

Typically prepared by roasting the lobster whole, the process involves seasoning the lobster with a blend of butter, garlic, herbs like thyme or parsley, and sometimes a dash of lemon for brightness. The lobster is then roasted in the oven until its shell turns a vibrant red and the meat inside becomes tender and succulent. The slow roasting allows the natural sweetness of the lobster to shine while enhancing it with the savory, aromatic flavors of the seasoning. Often served with sides like roasted vegetables, corn on the cob, or a fresh salad, a full lobster roast is a show-stopping dish perfect for special occasions or seafood feasts.
